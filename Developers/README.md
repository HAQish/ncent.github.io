You can use our Sandbox and SDK to build jobCent (hyperlink) or bugCent (hyperlink) or any front-end application you can think of!


Sandbox

The SDK interacts with the Sandbox which is a RESTful API server. The Sandbox interacts with a PostgreSQL database that stores your transactions, addresses and tokentypes in the back-end that is updated based on your API calls. You can find more information on the database schema, the API resources and calls here (hyperlink)!

You can git clone the sandbox and install postgreSQL (hyperlink) and start playing! Refer here for the tutorials (hyperlink)!

SDK

The SDK gives you a straightforward way to create a wallet address, stamp a token, transfer a token (signed using your private key), check your balance and destroy a token.

The SDK is the client-side application that sends a request to the back-end server that is your Sandbox and receives a response.
