## Coming Soon!

ncentSDK is a Javascript library for communicating with the nCent API. It is used for building nCent applications either on Node.js or in the browser, as well as for accessing base-level features on theAPI.

It will provide:
- a networking layer for endpoints on the back-end API.
- eventual facilities for building and signing transactions, for communicating with the backend API, and for submitting transactions or querying network history.
