Comming soon, the official implementation of the nCent decentralized ledger. When live, the ledger will facillitate decentralized verification of refferal transactions, token redemption, and all other nCent operations. Based in the Stellar protocol, the blockchain will be the fundamental method of recording nCent transactions, ensuring that all functions are properly recorded. On top of the ledger, our API and SDK can be used to perform nCent's functions, making it easy for developers to build applications on top of the blockchain.
