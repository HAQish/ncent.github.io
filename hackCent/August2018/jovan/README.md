# NomNomCent

## Why NomNomCent?

Food is essential. We die without food! Until now, there hasn't really been an online service (web or app) dedicated to food. Referral chain tracking through nCent would be an excellent way to incentivize food/restaurant discovery. Who knows, in the future this might be a better use of restaurants marketing money than advertising.


# Todo
Right now website just a landing page.

The backend folder just contains js test file to connect to Sandbox server.
Needs basic user auth, full communication with all SDK sandbox features, and basic restaurant directory / photo share logic and storage.

Will be using PostgreSQL for DBMS, and Express.
